# happy_number
My solution  

Task:

A happy number is a number where you can take the sum of the square digits and
then repeat on the new sum until you reach 1.
The number is not a happy number (unhappy number) if it ends in a never ending loop.
Example of a happy number: 31 => 3^2 + 1^2 => 10 => 1^2 + 0^2 = 1
Example of an unhappy number: 4 => 16 => 37 => 58 => 89 =>145 => 42 =>20 >= 4
You task is to write a program that prints the first happy numbers in natural
order found within the range 1 - 1000 to the console.
